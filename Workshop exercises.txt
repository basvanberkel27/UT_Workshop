Exercises in ADA codebase.


Exercise 1) Open ut_workshop.gpr. Explore the project. Draw the Class diagram and identify possible improvement points regarding testability.
Exercise 2) Draw the Class diagram with the improvement points
Exercise 3) Implement: Principle 5: Design for testability, interface-based designs. Implement the interface.
 	    Implement: Principle 4: Design for testability, dependency injection. Implement dependency injection.
Exercise 4) The SW design/code is ready to be unit tested. We have prepared some tests.
	    Copy "exercise 4" and build&run "testfixture_car.adb"
