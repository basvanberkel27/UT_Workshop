# Unit test workshop
This repository contains the workshop exercises of the Ada unit test training.

## (Optional) exercise 6
Create unit tests for the Add_One_Mile function of the `Diesel_Engine_If`.
The program can be build with the following command (from this folder): `gprbuild -p -P ut_workshop.gpr`.
The build executables can be found in the bin folder after building.

## Other exercises
This is the final exercise. To access the other exercises switch to the branch `exercise_X` (exercise 1 is in `main`). Use `git checkout BRANCH_NAME` to switch to a new branch.
The solutions for the exercise can be found in the branch of the next exercise.
