# unit test exercises

Each of these folder contains a exercise. They should be followed in order to learn the most.
In each folder an Ada project is present. Start by building the project. There is a powershell script provided with each exercise.

The first exercise is about creating (an) unit test(s) for an existing class.
In the subsequency exercises dependency injection is used to decouple the code and make it more testable.
Finally in the third exercise we are going to use mocks to create a test.
